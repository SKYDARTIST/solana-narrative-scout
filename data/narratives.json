        "explanation": "Solana is evolving from a user-centric chain to an agent-centric one. Developers are building persistent, autonomous on-chain actors that manage their own resources, API keys, and execution logic. This trend is driven by the need for high-frequency, logic-heavy interactions that are too fast for human manual input.",

By moving the majority of account data off-chain while maintaining security via SNARKs, developers can now build applications that were once too expensive. This is fostering a new economy of state-heavy dApps (e.g., massive-scale DePIN, complex identity systems).",
